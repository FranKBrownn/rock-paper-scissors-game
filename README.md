# Rock Paper Scissors Game

The Rock Paper Scissors Game is a game website where you can test your luck vs the AI to see if your chances can land you a win vs your oponent. 
Using a dice role in the code to determin the computers outcome ( rock player or Scissors) to demonstrate the uses of JavaScript.

## fetures

### heading with logs
The heading and logos are spit up into colours with all three, Rock, Papper and scissors having their own logo next to the name all in a diffrent colour to show appeal.

### the game board
 The game board is where the game takes place. it uses the same logos and colours from the heading and addes them into 6 diffrent buttons. three for the player and three for the Ai. the player would then pick one of the 3 items. the AI will then pick a number between 0-2 each number representing a diffrent item of its own. 
 the outcome will then be displayed as a alert. telling the player if the round has been won or lose. the results will them determing who loses a life. 

 ### lives
 I have added a life system. each side gets 3 lives counting down to 0 the player to lose all of their lives 1st loses. This is then followed by a congratulations or a better luck nect time depending on the out come. this will be shown through another alert.
